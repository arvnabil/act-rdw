# Common Section Routing Map

This document tracks where the components in this directory (`Components/Sections/Common`) are used. These are highly reusable sections intended for multiple pages.

| Component Name       | Primary Route/Page | Other Usage       | Notes                  |
| :------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------- |
| `ContactSection`     | `/about` (About)   | Likely many pages | Standard Contact strip |
| `TestimonialSection` | `/about` (About)   | -                 | Testimonial slider     |

**Recommendation:**
Any section used in more than one "Feature" folder (e.g. `ClientSection` used in Home and Services) should eventually move here.
